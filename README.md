Project Name: Champion's Quest

The application is a 2D RPG reminiscent of the late 80s/early 90s.  At the moment it is barebones compared to what I intend to do with it as it is mostly a front-end
skeleton with some basic scripts and functionality.  It allows you to login, view the Adventure Map, read some flavor text, and manage the names and models of several
of your party members.

I used HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery for this project.  HTML/CSS/JavaScript due to them being project requirements and also a modern way to interact with front-end
development, and jQuery to increase the functionality and ease of using JavaScript to perform more complex tasks.  Easier getting/setting, query selection, etc.

Some challenges I faced were regex validation for the e-mail and password.  The biggest pain point was getting the Camp page to work properly as it has the most
functionality and required a lot of selecting and replacing values.  Although not programming related, finding and editing the gifs to be usable for player models
was also a struggle.
